            <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Aura, a Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of California, Davis. My research revolves around MultiModal Foundation Models and Agentic Workflows, with a special focus on enhancing decision-making systems.</p>
            <p> During my PhD, I completed an internship as an Applied Scientist at Amazon with the Rufus team, focusing on Multimodality. I also spent a year at UC Berkeley as part of the UC Exchange Program. I have been involved in numerous machine learning projects that bridge the gap between academia and industry. </p>
            <p> I was involved in California Transportation projects for three years, developing an AI-based TMA truck targeted warning messaging system and enhancing vehicle detection technologies to improve safety and reduce accidents in highway work zones, while also working on ADA Ramp Compliance using Point Cloud and Image Processing. At Munich Re, I designed and implemented an efficient agentic MLLM workflow for automated report generation. I also developed a system for RAG-based retrieval, document question answering, and summarization. Additionally, I designed ads-related retrieval based on search and user history and developed an RL-based reward system based on human feedback for Myket (Android App Store).</p>
            <p> Additionally, I have led over 20 teams of graduate students in various industrial machine learning projects, focusing on addressing complex industrial challenges through innovative, state-of-the-art methods. </p>
